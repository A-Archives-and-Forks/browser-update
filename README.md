# browser-update
Many internet users are still using very old, out-dated browsers â€“ most of them for no actual reason. 
We want to remind these unobtrusively to update their browser.

##Goals
1. Provide webdesigners a unified way to tell the user that he needs a newer browser to use this website in all its beauty.
2. Improve the security, comfort and overall experiance of users by convincing them to update
3. But: do not annoy or lock out users

##Unobtrusive
Unobtrusive here means:
* We take care not to  erroneously notify users by constantly tweaking the detection code
* users of small niche browsers are not notified, users who have no possibility to update are not notified
* We do not block the users form using a website in any way
* The notification will only appear once a day by default
* The website can be used without any additional step
* If the user activly closes the notification, it will reappear after a week
